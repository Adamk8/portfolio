I am originally from Calgary but have been living in Victoria for 5 years since I began my degree. I chose to become a Software engineer after my first year of 
taking engineering courses at University. I wanted to do software engineering because it  was something that gained my interest during my first year, particularly 
because before university it was not a field that I knew much about.
