I am originally from Calgary but have been living in Victoria for 5 years since I began my degree. I chose to become a Software engineer after my first year of 
taking engineering courses at University. I wanted to do software engineering because it  was something that gained my interest during my first year, particularly 
because before university it was not a field that I knew much about.

application that supported various needs of our production team. These needs included metric tracking, defect tracking, printing instructions, printing labels, and  other 
small functions. I also implemented small tools for the engineering team like a tool that interacted with the Jira API to populate task sets for new projects. In this 
position I was the leading member of the software effort, so most design decisions were up to my discretion. I was also able to mentor another co-op student when they started
halfway through my time there.`;

export const motorolaIntro = `During this co-op term I worked on the systems engineering team at Motorola Solutions (Avigilon) where my main responsibilities were 
scripting Windows OS installations on servers and performance testing servers. The OS installation scripting was done using PowerShell and included stages for OS 
installation, applications installation, and running a test suite to confirm the installation was successful. These installation scripts were tested using a Bamboo 
build pipeline for CI. For the performance testing I was using the company's main application to test throughput and other characteristics of the servers. I also developed
performance testing tools in Python to aid in the testing process.`;

export const crescentpointIntro = `This was my first work experience at a technical field related to my studies. At this position I had two main responsibilities, 
one was to facilitate the upgrade process to Windows 10 and the other was to provide technical support to users within the company. The process for upgrading computers
involved evaluating the computer hardware to see if we were able to upgrade it or needed to replace it with a new machine. It also involved the OS upgrade process which
required trouble shooting because the process acted different on different sets of hardware. The technical support responsibilities I had were to answer support tickets,
 identify the problems, and fix or escalate the problem that was found.`;

export const schedulingDescription = `This project was during my capstone class, the goal of the project was to create a system that schedules courses for the 
university. The project was divided into four parts: frontend, backend, algorithm 1, and algorithm 2. Each team consisted of 20 people and spilt into 4 subgroups for
each part of the project. I was on the frontend team which gave me a chance to improve my UI/UX design skills along with introducing me to using a GraphQL API. On the
frontend team I was the scrum master which gave me a chance to practice my leadership and organizational skills. This was a good exercise in teamwork and communication 
as a team of 20 had to come up with a modular product in 4 month without having any previous work experience together. During
this project I appreciated the code reviews from my peers which I believe have helped me become a better software engineer. This was also my first time switching from 
JavaScript to TypeScript and I found that I like features of TypeScript and I believe it increased the quality of the code I wrote.`;

export const scalabilityDescription = `For my 'Software Scalability course I worked in a group to create a mock day trading system web application. The goal of 
this system was to be a scalable system to handle large workloads. This project was developed in a team of 4, my role in the team was to implement half of the 
backend routes for the REST API, create the load testing python script, create the login page, and setup/manage some of the AWS components. What I learned about most in this project
was the AWS components and how to deploy with AWS. I really enjoyed this because I had never had the chance to use a cloud deployment system and it was interesting 
to see the advantages and challenges it has.
