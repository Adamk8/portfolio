I am originally from Calgary but have been living in Victoria for 5 years since I began my degree. I chose to become a Software engineer after my first year of 
taking engineering courses at University. I wanted to do software engineering because it  was something that gained my interest during my first year, particularly 
because before university it was not a field that I knew much about.

application that supported various needs of our production team. These needs included metric tracking, defect tracking, printing instructions, printing labels, and  other 
small functions. I also implemented small tools for the engineering team like a tool that interacted with the Jira API to populate task sets for new projects. In this 
position I was the leading member of the software effort, so most design decisions were up to my discretion. I was also able to mentor another co-op student when they started
halfway through my time there.`;

export const motorolaIntro = `During this co-op term I worked on the systems engineering team at Motorola Solutions (Avigilon) where my main responsibilities were 
scripting Windows OS installations on servers and performance testing servers. The OS installation scripting was done using PowerShell and included stages for OS 
installation, applications installation, and running a test suite to confirm the installation was successful. These installation scripts were tested using a Bamboo 
build pipeline for CI. For the performance testing I was using the company's main application to test throughput and other characteristics of the servers. I also developed
performance testing tools in Python to aid in the testing process.`;

export const crescentpointIntro = `This was my first work experience at a technical field related to my studies. At this position I had two main responsibilities, 
one was to facilitate the upgrade process to Windows 10 and the other was to provide technical support to users within the company. The process for upgrading computers
involved evaluating the computer hardware to see if we were able to upgrade it or needed to replace it with a new machine. It also involved the OS upgrade process which
required trouble shooting because the process acted different on different sets of hardware. The technical support responsibilities I had were to answer support tickets,
 identify the problems, and fix or escalate the problem that was found.`;
